PetsRUs is a simple, interactive e-commerce website generated with HTML, CSS, JS, 
and Bootstrap. The website contains a homepage, about page, and multiple product 
pages. Each product page contains a form that allows the user to input information,
such as name, shipping address, and payment information, to buy the product, as per 
project guidelines.

consists of a navigation bar that will take you to 3 sections: the homepage, 
the about page, and the main (all) products page. The 3rd tab has a dropdown menu
that will navigate to 3 different categories of pet items based on pet type (dog,
cat, and reptile). 

about.html
The about.html page contains information about PetsRUs, including redirections to
product pages and information about the management team. 

product-pages
Clicking on those tab dropdowns will take you to the main page
for each pet type and a list of all products available for that pet. Clicking on
the "more info" button or product picture will lead you to that product's page. 
The product page contains additional information about a product, key features, 
and a product order form. 

error-page.html
The error-page.html is a backup page that is only displayed when a redirection
issue occurs. Since all links in this project are viable , you should not get 
here.
